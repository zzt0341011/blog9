[sing-box VT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sing-box-vt/id6673731168) is a multifunctional proxy platform designed specifically for iPhone users, and it also supports Mac, iPad, and Apple TV. It offers a range of features for creating and managing network proxy servers. Released on the Apple platform on September 18, 2024, sing-box VT stands out as one of the few free proxy software options, with a compact size of just over 20 MB. Since its launch, it has been well-received by many users. The application allows users to easily set up clients and transparent proxies to meet various network needs.

Compared to [Shadowrocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowrocket/id932747118), which costs $3, and [Satsh](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stash-rule-based-proxy/id1596063349), which costs $4, sing-box VT is a strong contender on the Apple platform. Its design focuses on speed and customization, making it suitable for both regular and advanced users.

Moreover, sing-box VT supports the management of local, iCloud, and remote sing-box configuration files, offering flexibility and convenience. It also includes platform-specific functionality to enhance its usability across different environments.
